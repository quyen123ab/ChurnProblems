Thank you for downloading this file and watching it 
Today I want to explain to all of you my plan
The first is data processing. In my understanding, data processing is simple, dealing with data that is missing, flawed, and incomplete. Finally pass them all back to the type of data that the model can understand.
I took a look and found the data was fine and there were no issues but I still left a file called data_process.py for everyone to check for themselves.
Next I decided to find some key features because there are 21 features and it will not be possible to have enough time and energy to look at each one. So I made a WhatExactlyYouWantToDo.py file to consider the importance of each feature and select a few.
Next is to find out the difference between keeping 2 types of customers, 1 type is to stay, one type is to leave, then find out why customers leave and how to retain customers. 
I just use the decribe() command to give data and then use chatGPT to analyze the data, but if you're really good at it, you can write a model that does all of the above. I will put the file class classification.py.
